<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Chess is played on a board of 64 squares alternate between two colors: light (e.g. white) and dark (e.g. black).</p>
<p>A playerâ€™s army consists of 16 pieces that begin play on the two ranks closest to that player.</p>
<p>There are six different types of pieces; king, rook, bishop, queen, knight, and pawn. Each has a different appearance and moves.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chess is played between two opponents with different colored pieces (usually black and white).</li>
    <li>White moves first, and players take turns following fixed rules until the end of the game.</li>
    <li>Legal moves should be highlighted in green, and illegal moves (e.g., blocking own pieces, putting the king in check) should be highlighted in red.</li>
    <li>Eaten pieces of each player should be displayed on the sidebar.</li>
    <li>The win condition is to force the opponent's king into checkmate.</li>
</ul>

            <li>When reaching the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except the king).</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Moves one square in any direction.</li>
            <li>Castling: A special move where the king moves two spaces towards a rook, and the rook moves to the other side of the king under specific conditions.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Bishop (Elephant):</h4>
        <ul>
